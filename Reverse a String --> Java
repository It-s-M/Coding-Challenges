Problem:
Reverse a String   from: https://www.sololearn.com/learning/eom-project/1068/950


Write a program to take a string as input and output its reverse.
The given code takes a string as input and converts it into a char array, which contains letters of the string as its elements.

Sample Input:
hello there

Sample Output:
ereht olleh
You can loop through the char array, starting from the end, using arr.length to get the size of the array.


Solutions:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Program {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		String text = scanner.nextLine();
		char[] arr = text.toCharArray();
    
		for (int i = arr.length; i>0; i--) {
			System.out.println(arr[i-1]);
		}
		
    for (int i = arr.length-1; i>=0; i--) {
		 	System.out.println(text.charAt(i));
		}
    
    
		//your code goes here: Explanations
    
 		for (int i = arr.length; i>0; i--) {
      System.out.println(arr[i-1]);
    }
// you need i > 0  &&  (arr[i-1]) because arr is the length of the array and you're printing from the last character backwards

// and for

for (int i = arr.length-1; i>=0; i--) { 
  System.out.println(text.charAt(i));
}

//You need i = arr.length-1  &&  i >= 0 because i goes all the way down to 0 and in that case you'll just be printing i

//and arr[i-1] means the previous character in the array.
		
	}
}
